This repository contains tools and resources to make learning easier.

## [QC and Qiskit Study Tracker](https://github.com/quantum-kittens/Learning-Tools/blob/main/QC_and_Qiskit_Study_Tracker.xlsx)

This is a free downloadable Excel study tracker that you can adapt to suit your own learning goals. 

Iâ€™ve provided two sample task lists and a task list template. The sample lists encapsulate two of the learning paths offered on the IBM Quantum Learning Platform:


-  [Getting Started with Qiskit](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/learning-path/getting-started-with-qiskit)

- [Understanding quantum information and computation](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/learning-path/understanding-quantum-information-and-computation) 

(Please visit these links to view the prerequisites and who these paths are intended for.)

You can use this tracker to consolidate resources, plan when to tackle them, and track your progress. This sheet can be adapted for other subjects and learning goals as well.
