# So You Want to Host a Challenge Party

Challenge parties are local, in-person gatherings where you can bring together enthusiastic learners in your area to work through the interactive coding labs collaboratively, usually centered around a specific challenge or virtual event like the Qiskit Global Summer School run by IBM Quantum. It's a great way to build quantum community, and help others get more out of the virtual event experience.

Here, we provide some ideas, inspiration, and guidance on how you can potentially organize a challenge party in your local institution. Remember: these are simply suggestions, feel free to adapt any ideas to suit your needs and to get creative! 


## Challenge Party Formats

### Location Suggestions
- **Conference rooms** - Book a space at your workplace/university
- **Coffee shopss** - Casual atmosphere with laptops and lattes
- **Library study rooms** - Quiet, focused environment
- **Co-working spaces** - Professional setting with good wifi


### Timing/Frequency Suggestions
- **Daily mini-sessions** - 1-2 hours after the release of each lab
- **Weekend intensives** - Tackle multiple labs in longer sessions
- **Evening coding parties** - After-work collaborative sessions
- **Lab sprints** - Focus on one lab per gathering
- **Marathon sessions** - All-day events with breaks and meals

## Engagement Ideas

### Lab Approaches
- **Pair programming** - Two people, one keyboard, shared problem-solving
- **Team sessions** - Divide into small groups, compare solutions
- **Code reviews** - Present and discuss different approaches
- **Debugging circles** - Help each other troubleshoot issues
- **Whiteboard sessions** - Sketch out quantum concepts before coding

### Making It Engaging
- **Solution sharing** - Compare different approaches to the same problem
- **Mini presentations** - Have someone explain a concept they figured out
- **Group debugging** - Tackle errors together
- **Progress check-ins** - Quick pulse checks and rounds of where everyone's at

### Social Suggestions
- **Bring snacks** - Pizza, coffee, whatever works for your group
- **Take photos** - Document the collaboration and fun
- **Celebrate wins** - Acknowledge when someone solves a tough problem
- **Background music** - Keep energy up during coding sessions

## Execution Tips

### Planning & Organization
- **Create event calendars** - Share schedules in advance
- **Set up communication channels** - WhatsApp groups, Slack channels, Discord servers, etc
- **Plan logistics** - Parking, food, wifi passwords, extension cords

### Technical Setup Options
- **Test environments** - Make sure everyone has set up and can run whatever software you are using
- **Shared repositories** - GitHub repos for collaborative code sharing
- **Screen sharing setup** - Large monitors or projectors for group viewing
- **Backup plans** - Alternative internet, power strips, troubleshooting docs
- **Documentation** - Shared notes, solution summaries, key insights

### Group Dynamics
- **Mix skill levels** - Pair beginners with experienced practitioners
- **Rotate partnerships** - Change pairs/groups for different challenges
- **Encourage questions** - Create safe spaces for "stupid questions"
- **Share teaching** - Let different people lead different topics
- **Celebrate progress** - Acknowledge effort, not just correct answers

## Making It Memorable

### Simple Keepsake Ideas
- **Group photos** - Get everyone together and take a photo!
- **Shared notes** - Collaborative documents with key insights
- **Contact exchange** - Help people stay connected after the event is over
- **Social posts** - Share highlights on LinkedIn and the Qiskit Advocate Hub on Discord

## Getting Started

1. **Gauge interest** - Survey your local network
2. **Choose format and location** 
3. **Set dates** - Align with the event schedule 
4. **Secure space** - Book rooms or identify the location where you want to host the challenge party
5. **Communicate** - Share details, expectations, and prep materials
6. **Execute** - Have fun learning together!


## What an Example Challenge Party May Look Like

We'll take the Qiskit Global Summer School 2025 as an example.

 QGSS 2025 has 14 online lectures led by IBM Quantum experts and interactive coding labs with hands-on quantum concept exploration in the form of 4 primary coding challenges and bonus challenges. (For more information on QGSS, check out the [IBM Quantum blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qiskit-summer-school-2025).)

You send out a feeler to scope out who in your university is participating in QGSS. You book a conference room or a classroom or a section in your cafeteria for an entire Friday evening after classes end. Everyone brings snacks and beverages of their choice, maybe you all pitch in to buy a pizza. 

You share jokes and high fives and then you dive into tackling as many interactive labs as you can. You make sure everyone can run Qiskit before starting by having them complete Lab 0 first - Lab 0 ensures your account is set up correctly, and everything is running smoothly.

You work on your respective laptops, but pair up and help each other whenever you are stuck. You take periodic breaks for pulse checks, and if there's a common bug that almost everyone is facing, you pause and work together. You may even pull out a white board or a projector to solve the problem together!

Every time someone successfully passes a problem submission they announce it, for instance: "I just solved Lab 3 exercise 1!" And there's a short cheer of contragulations around the room before people plug back into what they are doing. And when someone completes a lab, you take a moment and clink glasses or dole out high fives.

If you are in a closed room, you may even (softly) play instrumental productivity music to set the atmosphere, after checking with everyone whether they are fine with it. You may even take short stretching or dance breaks. You remind everyone to hydrate.

And, of course, you take lots of photos! Dont forget to ask permission for taking someone's photo and ask whether they're comfortable sharing on social media.

Remember: The goal is to help event participants learn together and build connections. Keep it relaxed and focused on collaborative problem-solving. Have fun and happy learning!
